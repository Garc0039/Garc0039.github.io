					<span class="post-p-header"> Strengths: What do you do best? What are your positive traits? </span>
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					I do best in learning by my mistakes which are a lot. I learn with each mistake I do something new and try not to do the mistake twice.
					I also like to dive into information and data of IT so I learn the most and can widen my knowledge. 
					My positive traits are that I am open to study any new thing. I am very passionate when it comes to something I appreciate and like which 
					I hope will come in handy during my studies.
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<span class="post-p-header"> Weaknesses: What personality traits may be holding you back in your studies / career? </span>
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					My traits which could hold me back from my studies would be that I often am lazy, I must be honest don't I. Which does not mean that I do not work. 
					I know when I have to work and then I also do so but when I know that I have time for something I do not do it on the instant. I have been trying to 
					make it better since 2 weeks now and I will for sure try to make that aspect of mine go away during my studies. I am also kind of a quiet guy but when 
					I have something that disturbs me I let everyone know so we can find a solution for it. So all in all I would say that these aspects could hold me back 
					but I will for sure try my best to work on myself.
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<span class="post-p-header"> Opportunities: How can you turn your strengths / weaknesses into opportunities? </span>
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					Well that depends on what you mean with opportunities but for example with my weaknesses I could create a situation in which someone could help me and 
					then I can maybe help them with my strenghts. I could also help other people who have difficulties in something I am potencially good at and create an 
					opportunity to get to know these people but also make their studies a bit easier. 
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<span class="post-p-header"> Threats What obstacles do you face to succeed as a student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from succeeding in your studies / career? </span>
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					In terms of weaknesses (laziness, everything mentioned before) preventing me from succeeding in my studies I would say that it may be an obstacle. I will 
					of course try my best to work on myself and I will approach to work daily and regularly on my studies

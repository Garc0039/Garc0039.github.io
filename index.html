					<span class="post-p-header"> Why I think the ICT field may or may not suit me </span> 
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					I think that the ICT field may suit me because ever since I can think of I have been playing games and explore how some stuff works. I have always been
					intersted to know how consols and pcs work and therefor read myself through articles or consumed tons of videos on youtube about the certan topics I was/am 
					interested on such like, on how a CPU works or a graphics card and so on. I never went into the very detail but accepted the info I got from the internet and 
					ever since then I never stopped looking up stuff or show my interest on ICT related things. Eventually I also showed interest on the coding part of the hardware we use
					and got hooked to it because of a very good and friendly ICT teacher of mine. He showed me the world of coding and I got to dive a bit into the coding part of ICT. 
					In conclusion I believe that the ICT field suits me because I have always shown interest to it and I will hopefully manage to pass all 4 years with all the work and time
					I will put into it.

					I think that the ICT field may suit me because ever since I can think of I have been playing games and explore how some stuff works. I have always been
					interested to know how consols and pcs work and therefor read myself through articles or consumed tons of videos on youtube about the certan topics I am/was 
					interested in, such like how a CPU works or a graphics card and so on. I never went into the very detail but accepted the info I got from the internet and 
					ever since I never stopped looking up stuff or show my interest on ICT related things. Eventually I also showed interest on the coding part of the hardware we use
					and got hooked to it because of a very good and friendly ICT teacher of mine. He showed me the world of coding and I got to dive a bit into the coding part of ICT. 
					In conclusion I believe that the ICT field suits me because I have always shown interest to it and I will hopefully manage to pass all 4 years with all the work and time
					I will put into it.

					Due to my early interest and search for knowledge about hardware as well as some software, I happened to find out about the custom keyboard community
					and when I turned 18 years old I finally happened to buy everything I needed for my own keyboard and then built it myself. Ever since I have been buying parts
					for it and kept changing parts of the keyboard. The keyboard case might be the next change just for the yikes because metal cases look and sound better. My keyboard is also a
					60% keyboard so I basically save a lot of space on my desk and can take my keyboard with me wherever I want it too such like university. If you feel inspired by the wonderful text
					and are willing to spend hundreds of euros into the project then feel free to check out the following list with the parts you need to build one yourself:
					
					<ul>
					
						<li/> PCB (Printed Circuit Board) (Hot Swap if you do not want to solder the switches to the PCB yourself)
						
						<li/> Switches (do not take speed switches or whatsoever they do not make as big of a difference as you think)
						
						<li/> Stabs (Stabilizers to prevent the larger keys from being all wobbly)
						
						<li/> Plate (The plate basically holds the switches safe together)
						
						<li/> USB-C cable (custom cables are fancy, get these)
						
						<li/> Keycaps
						
						<li/> Case
						
						<li/> Preference: case foam to change the sound of your switches
						
						<li/> Preference: lube, to make the stabs and switches smoother which also affects the sound of your keyboard
					
					</ul>

					Dear David,
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					Thank you for filling in the who am I form, Great to read about your inspiring teacher! You will get the hang of the coding part 
					it just takes time, practice, and some teaching.  interesting to read you want to enter the gaming industry. A lot of our students 
					have gaming as a hobby. you will have plenty of time to find out in which direction you would like to go. We will also provide you 
					with companies to inform you of all kinds of IT career opportunities for your future.. procrastinating is what most students suffer from,
					or having trouble to start We will give you some pointers for this to help you out but in the end, you are the only one who can do the job!
					You will. learn how to focus on what matters most to do first might help you out. I'll look forward to meeting you I our information session 
					and welcome you to our program upcoming school year.
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					I the information sessions we all through the program and what you will be doing the first quartile. Don't hesitate to post your question during 
					the session, we are happy to respond and answer them for you. You will have a full-time schedule planned for you for the two weeks and after that, 
					there is variation between workshops/lectures and self-study. 
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					Kind regards,
					
					<br>
					<br>

					I thought that it was very inspiring and very helpful to get a feedback like this because as someone who does not really know where this will lead me to it gave me some hope
					that I would manage to find a way to really dive in deep into a special part of IT. It was also good to know that we would have some self study part so we can work a bit on our 
					own which I really appreciate. In conclusion it lead a way for me to be able to dive into different aspects of IT.

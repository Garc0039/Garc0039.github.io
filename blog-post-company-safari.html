					HackerOne is a collective of hackers working for good instead of bad. The bad people who use it against other people for malicious interests are so called 'Crackers' which is the 
					complete opposit of hackers from HackerOne. Their hackers are described as skilled and experienced people making programs in an enthusiastic and fun way. So you do need a certain amount
					of skill and knowledge to understand their code and way to think. But by now you are probably wondering how they work and if you could also be part of them. As a matter of fact yes you
					can indeed work with and for them you just send them a mail or contact them via <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none;"> HackerOne.com </a> and then you might 
					enter the holy circle of HackerOne. As for what services they offer or what you could work for them as is clearly communicated:
				
				</p>
				
				<ol>
						
					<li/> Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)
						
					<li/> Bug Bounty Program (BBP)
					
					<li/> Hacker Powered Pentest (HPP)	  	
						 
				</ol>
				
				<p>
				
					VPD is their offered service about them solivng and looking for issues in your code. You can basically send them their code and they will try to find the issues of it. 
					Bug Bounty is a very interesting and very good way for you to find issues and vulnerabilites of your website. This program is all about a group of hackers or even one only
					looking for bugs, not the animals but little loop holes you may have on your website. This is one of the best ways for the hackers to get paid since the price point per solved issue, depending 
					on the difficulty of finding and fixing the loop hole, can reach from $100 up to $18.000.
